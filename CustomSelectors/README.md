# Time Events Using CustomSelectorTypes


### The Problem

Many customers want to track time against many different things. Adding all of
the various types of things people want to track time against is difficult.
Additionally adding a new type, might be undesirable for existing users.

### The Solution

Let customers define the things that their time is tracked against. Let them
create any number of new selectors. Let them define what a selector looks like.


### Basic Model

We have a basic setup. A team of teammembers that track their time by selecting 
multiple SelectorObjects (each having a SelectorType).
